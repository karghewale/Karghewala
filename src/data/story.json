      "description": {
        "1": "From an intimately known market to middle-layer driven value chains, the design agency shifted from artisans totally to the added layers, making artisans mere implementation centres. The middle-layer driven value chains continue to exist and thrive today. Here, the weaver artisans are having to trade their labour to produce textiles, without much creative agency in the process, links their earnings to their labour, not so much their skill.",
        "2": "Even in fair trade, labour wages are more likely to be subsistence, than attractive; leading to the younger generation of weavers leaving the craft to try their fortunes at more fashionable vocations. A story of severely curtailed creative agency of artisans brought on by a sheer predominance of handmade manufacturing-based interventions."
